## 3. Technical Migration Plan

### 3.1 Contract Deployment Strategy

**Deployment Order**:

2. `ZKVerifierV4.sol` (new verifier with corrected bias)
3. `ValidationPoolV4Integration.sol` (enhanced pools)
4. Migration coordinator contract
5. Frontend integration updates

**Deployment Configuration**:
```solidity
// Migration-safe deployment with pause capabilities
contract MigrationCoordinator {
    bool public migrationActive = false;
    address public legacyZKVerifier;
    address public v4ZKVerifier;
    
    modifier onlyDuringMigration() {
        require(migrationActive, "Migration not active");
        _;
    }
    
    function enableMigration() external onlyAdmin {
        migrationActive = true;
        emit MigrationActivated(block.timestamp);
    }
}
```

### 3.2 Data Migration Strategy

**State Preservation**:

    function getPoolStatus() external view returns (bool, bool, uint256, uint256, uint256);
    // ... all existing functions maintained
}
```
