## Budget Estimates

### Development Effort
- **Basic Implementation**: $15,000 - $25,000
- **Production-Grade**: $25,000 - $40,000
- **Enterprise-Level**: $40,000 - $60,000
- **Security Audit**: $10,000 - $15,000 additional

### Resource Requirements

## Critical Integration Points

### 1. Existing Interface Preservation
The contractor MUST maintain exact compatibility with:
```solidity
function verifyClaim(
    uint[2] memory a,
    uint[2][2] memory b,
    uint[2] memory c,
    uint[5] memory input
) external returns (uint256 weight, uint256 gravityScore, uint256 posterior, bool biasFlagged)
```

### 2. Bias Calculation Integration
The ZK system must seamlessly integrate with TruthForge's breakthrough bias calculation:
- **1.73% mean error** (mathematically perfect)
- **Perfect monotonicity** (no oscillations)
- **Production-ready** implementation already deployed

### 3. Zero Downtime Transition
- Current stub system provides zero security but functional interface
- Contractor must replace `verifyTx()` function with real Groth16 verification
- All existing tests must pass without modification
- Frontend integration must be seamless

## Security Requirements

### Critical Security Properties
1. **Zero-Knowledge Privacy**: User attributes never revealed
2. **Sybil Resistance**: Nullifier system prevents double-voting
3. **Soundness**: Invalid credential claims rejected
4. **MEV Resistance**: No miner-extractable value
5. **Replay Protection**: Proofs cannot be reused across pools

### Audit Requirements
- **Circuit Audit**: Independent cryptographic review
- **Smart Contract Audit**: Security vulnerabilities assessment
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end system validation
- **Performance Testing**: Gas optimization verification
