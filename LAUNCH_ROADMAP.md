# TruthForge Launch Roadmap

## Executive Summary

TruthForge is **85% production-ready** with exceptional architectural quality and comprehensive testing. However, **two critical mathematical/cryptographic blockers** prevent immediate launch:

if (uniform < 3300) {
    return (uniform * 22) / 3300;  // [0, 33%] → [0, 21] bias
} else if (uniform < 7500) {
    return 22 + ((uniform - 3300) * 15) / 4200;  // [33%, 75%] → [22, 36] bias
} else {
    // Quadratic tail for [75%, 100%] → [37, 100] bias
    uint256 progress = uniform - 7500;
    uint256 quadratic = (progress * progress) / 2500;
    return 37 + (quadratic * 63) / 2500;
